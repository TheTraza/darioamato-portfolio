        <!-- Descrizione del progetto -->
        <div class="description">
            <p>Missing Milk Cartons is a project in the crypto world, created under my online alias "gonerotten," where I explored NFT technology and tested the NFT auction platform Foundation. The concept is inspired by vintage American milk cartons, replacing missing children with the creators of famous crypto tokens, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance. Instead of nutritional information, the carton displays the tokenâ€™s value and statistics at the time the NFT was created.</p>
            <p>The project involved producing visual teasers (both videos and images) prior to the NFT drop, followed by the creation of three unique milk carton NFTs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance. I used 3DS Max for 3D modeling, Photoshop for graphics, Substance Painter for texturing, Marmoset for lighting and rendering, and After Effects for post-production.</p>
